******************************* Files and extensions we had to download for our hand gesture rock paper scissors test MVP ****************************************



1. OpenCV from "Website URL". (Instructions on how to setup is on the website, will have to add a path by 'Editing Environment Variables on your account' on your device.)

2. CMake from "Website URL" (Will Also rquire you to 'Edit Environment Variables on your account' on your device.)

    (NOTE: At the end of the paths, you should have 3 new paths. 2 for OpenCv (bin and lib, both version 16) and 1 for CMake bin. )



C++/C extensions from Microsoft on VSCode are required to build and run the main.cpp file created by the CMakeLists.txt file. If you already don't have any.
